## Notes
### Chapter 0
Build Configuration
- Add -ggdb to the command line when debugging and -O2 -DNDEBUG for release builds.
- You can disable compiler extensions by adding the -pedantic-errors flag to the compile command line.
- For warnings, add the following flags to your command line: -Wall -Weffc++ -Wextra -Wconversion -Wsign-conversion
  - To treat warnings as errors, add the following flag to your command line: -Werror
- To configure language standard, you can pass compiler flags -std=c++11, -std=c++14, -std=c++17, or -std=c++20 to enable C++11/14/17/20 support respectively

### Chapter 1
Variable assignment and initialization
- =*operator* is called the **assignment** operator
  - assignment copies the value on the right-hand side of the = operator to the variable on the left-hand side of the operator. This is called copy assignment
- When a variable is defined, you can also provide an initial value for the variable at the same time. This is called initialization.
- Initializations
  - int a; // default initialization
  - int b = 5; // copy initialization
    - Copy initialization is also used whenever values are implicitly copied or converted, such as when passing arguments to a function by value, returning from a function by value, or catching exceptions by value.
  - int c(6); // direct initialization
  - int d {7}; // direct list initialization
    - it disallows “narrowing conversions”
    - Prefer direct list initialization (or value initialization) for initializing your variables.
  - int e = {8}; // copy list initialization
  - int f {}; // value initialization
    -  In most cases, value initialization will initialize the variable to zero (or empty, if that’s more appropriate for a given type). In such cases where zeroing occurs, this is called zero initialization.
- Initialization gives a variable an initial value at the point when it is created. Assignment gives a variable a value at some point after the variable is created.
- Default initialization is when a variable initialization has no initializer (e.g. int x;). In most cases, the variable is left with an indeterminate value.
- Value initialization is when a variable initialization has an empty brace (e.g. int x{};). In most cases this will perform zero-initialization
